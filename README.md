Teaching Assistant Performance Analysis

🔹 Project Summary

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting teaching assistant (TA) performance using classification techniques. The dataset included evaluation scores categorized into performance levels.

🚀 Key Contributions

Preprocessed academic evaluation data and handled categorical encoding

Performed EDA to understand factors affecting teaching performance

Built classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, .Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting.

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Identified the most influential features impacting TA performance

Gradient Boosting is recommended for deployment in production environments due to its superior overall accuracy, balanced performance across classes, proficiency in managing mixed feature types, robustness against skewed data and small datasets, and its effective reduction of bias and variance.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

📈 Outcome

The model successfully classified TA performance into categories (Low, Medium, High), helping demonstrate how data-driven approaches can support academic evaluation systems.
